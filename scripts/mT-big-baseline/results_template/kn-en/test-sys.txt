Among them, medium-sized cats are the most commonly eaten by hunting common-sized rabbits, tigers, and deer.
Finally, there are several small cats (including pets) that hunt small insects, mammals, teeth and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of nest, a special work with each dog that prevents them from competing with others.
In the dog species, the lions live in large groups known as praids, who love social life.
The prides are composed of 1 to 3 related adult males, along with thirty females and females.
Since the sisters and daughters are the largest family, there is a close relationship between the daughters.
Lion pride behaves like a string of arms or dogs, which in behavior are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) and very deadly to their prey.
A tiger can climb efficiently (though not well enough), swim, fly angrily for a long distance, and pull out five forces of a strong man.

Osilots prefer to eat small animals, if they are able to catch monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds. almost all animals that hunt Osilots are smaller in size.
Scientists think that animals (bullies) follow and find animals to eat from the habit of resting on the ground.
They have eyes that are clearly visible in the darkness, and they can move as far as anyone can see. the Osilots are as mixed together as they are not seen in their surrounding area, and then they rise on their prey.
When smaller groups of organisms (small populations) are separated from their adjacent main group (when they cross a mountain range as they cannot easily return, or when they cross a river, or sometimes go to a new island), those groups find that they have a different atmosphere than they had before
This new environment has different resources and different antagonisms, so different features or adaptations are required for a new population to become a sustainable antagonist than previously required.
The original population has not changed, they still need transformations.
Over time, when new generations began to adapt to their new environment, they hardly looked confidently towards other communities.
Thousands or millions of years later, the two communities look different, so they are not called the same species.
We call this process the depopulation, the creation of new depopulation means that depopulation is an inevitable process and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., confidence and certainty).

If you have seen the National Trailer, you might think that a map of funds has been written prior to the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. although an icon is written in the back of the letter, it's not a graph showing the funds.
At the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words Basic Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. the text appears for the head at the bottom of the document.
Although those who wrote it were not aware of who it was, in the days when we knew it was made, this large leather paper (which is 29 3â4 inch X 24 1â2 inch in size) was placed around the tunnel.
Thus, the comment is likely to be simply labelled.

In just two weeks, the Americans and independent French forces released South France, heading towards Germany.
Citizenship is a single culture, shared by a significant large group living and working with the cooperation of a society.
"The term" "civilization" "comes from the Latin word" "civilis", "which gives meaning to" "citizens" "or" "citizens" "or" "citizens" "or" "states" "and defines the community as a whole."
Cities-states are the ancestors of nations. a educated culture advocates the spread of knowledge to every next several generations, which is the path and best spread of the enduring culture.
There is no historical evidence for small cultures and they cannot be identified as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Congress was its only unit, formed the weak central government first, including thirteen states under the federal annexation policies.

For example, the world's most common steel image photography format is 35 mm, which was the size of the film screen at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still being produced, however, its shape ratio is inherited from digital camera image sensor forms.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, 36mm wide 24mm high.
So the spectral ratio of this format is said to be 3: 2.
Many common forms (APS series forms) are equivalent or approximate to this shape ratio.
One-third of the most heavily abused and ever-ridiculed rule is a simple rule that preserves the measure of an image's action.
According to it, the most effective area of the main subject of an image is the intersection of the lines that appear when the image is divided into three parts in length and horizontally.
During this time in the history of the century, the Catholic Church, rich and powerful, was investigated.
For about a thousand years, Christianity had held European kingdoms despite the diversity of their language and traditions.
Its entire power spread from the king to the common man.
One important aspect of Christian theories is that wealth is used to alleviate poverty and to help those in distress, and that is the purpose of the church's financial collection.
The central authority of the church has been established in Rome for several millennia, and the centralization of this authority and money raises several questions as to whether this theory is being maintained.

He returned to Paris in the air amid a crowd that was surrounded by threats against the king and queen.
A group of people urged the king and queen to open their chariot kits further.
At one point, a man in the crowd threw the head of Royal Guard, who was killed in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The people of the Philippines themselves paid for the expenses of the imperial U.S. war to contract the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial administration to take over the high-cost parts, and were charged interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street Banking Houses.
However, the greatest benefits of the long-term exploitation of the people of the Philippines brought basic benefits to American imperialism.
Before we understand the Templars, we need to understand the direction that triggered its sequence creation.
The epoch of events is generally known as the upper medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (BC 1000-1300).
The Middle Ages, which were in high condition, were from the early Middle Ages to the late Middle Ages, which ended in about 1500.
"" "The term" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Technical Determisam" "" "is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas from a technical-push or technical imperative to a strict understanding that their expression can be written as a human being in the logic and technology based on scientific laws." ""
"Most definitions of technical determinations share two common ideas, namely: technology development often follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and technology has" "consequences" "on societies that are more socially mainstream than mainstream."
For example, one can say that motor cars are the main reason for the development of roads.
However, national road connectivity is not only economically profitable for a handful of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
More car ownership led to more road accidents, leading to the discovery of new health technologies to repair damaged bodies.
Romantism had a major component of cultural control derived from writers such as Goethe, PhishÃ©, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped personality, and over time, systems and cultures related to that geography were born, adapted to the state of society, which might not have been better than the laws imposed indiscriminately.
Paris was considered to be the fashion capital of Europe, in a model known as the fashion capital of contemporary world.
It started at about 400 C.P. and was named as the center of luxury up to 1100 C.P.
Its condition declined in the twelfth century, with gifts such as silk and spices that were more valuable than the Byzantine market.
At the same time, the title Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style developed during the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, dress was very popular with the Byzantine tradition in the East.
However, due to slow communication methods, the lifestyle of the western province can last for 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. as a result of the war of religion, people began to use buttons to wear clothes, one of the largest developments of the time.
Livestock farming is carried out to produce food that meets the needs of farmers and their families.
Livestock farming is a simple, organic system that uses locally-friendly seed collection sources that combine crop rotation or similar simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically, many farmers have adopted subsistence farming and it is still in operation in many developing countries.
Sub-works consider like-minded individuals neglected by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Sub-works can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, place and / or female / male information.
Subculture can be characterized by a combination of language, beauty, religion, politics, sex, geography, or elements.
Members of the subculture usually symbolize their membership in a unique and symbolic style, including scents, behaviors, and argot.
One of the most common ways of describing the importance of socialization is by growing up, being portrayed on certain uncertain occasions by children who are vulnerable to social exclusion, forced exploitation, neglect or unhappiness.
Such persons are known as children who are malnourished or malnourished. some children who are malnourished are kept away by the public (usually by their parents); in some cases, the parents reject the child's severe intellectual or physical weakness and the child grows up.
Even before they were orphaned or fled, they might have suffered severe physical injury or abuse.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in forests themselves.
When completely bred by non-human animals, the animal hair displays the characteristics of that particular animal as much as possible (within its physical limits), i.e., the qualities that make humans afraid or indifferent.
Planning-based learning simplifies learning, as well as taking a step forward makes you more interested, more willing (scaffolding).
The scaffolding of Siddha is not just an learning practice, it offers cooperation to individuals who are getting a new learning experience, i.e., starting a new project or using a computer program.
The tenor of the theory (scaffold) can be either real or subjective, i.e., a teacher may also be a kind of scaffold as well as a small paper clipman at the Microsoft Office is also scaffolded.
The software has an internalized virtual coffee folder that is used to question, promote and describe the method of action that students cannot understand themselves.
Children are placed in a Foster Care for various reasons, including neglect, cruelty and extortion.
No child should ever grow in a nurturing, caring and educational environment, but they do.
We see this child as a safety zone.
Our orphanage care system was to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, sustainable education and reliable health care.
He used to provide all the necessities of the house he had previously taken.
InterNetwork, group communication and people-to-people communication combine elements.
The use of different characteristics of the Internet and the additional dimensions that give pleasure.
"For example," "learning" "and" "socialization" "have been cited as major motivations for Internet use (James Atl, 1995)."
"" "Personal involvement" "and" "" "Continued Relationships" "" have been identified as new motivational factors by the IGM and the Maccard (1998) when examining the audience's reactions to the websites. "
Video shooting has helped detect an analysis of sensitive emotions and facial expressions with only a short period of time.
In particular, it is said that by correctly defining a sensitive expression, one can find out whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sachs, in his report The Presidents Speaker, explains how people who are unable to understand the speech accurately measure honesty.
They suggest that the ability to define human conduct can also be found in animals such as mammals.
20th-century research has shown that there are two boundaries of genetic change: they are individual and invisible.
The mutation is the gateway to a new genetic difference and eliminates it from the source of the apparent changes.
Separation and re-integration differences thrive between two groups in each generation.
Over savanna, it is very difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet the amino-acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences, namely: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
Plant-borne proteins can be easily obtained from greenhouses and pulses, but it is difficult to cover them unless cooked for mammals such as ours.
In contrast, animal foods (eagles, victors, eggs) are not easily digested, but they provide a high proportion of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
After considering all the issues, we should not be surprised if our forefathers had solved their protein problem to some extent in the way that chimpanzees do chimpanzees in savanna.
Sleep disruption is a short-term sleep (10-60 minutes) after consciously waking up during normal sleep.
Using a very audible alarm clock, you can wake up easily
If you find the clock resting in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room
Another bio-rich option is to consume a lot of liquid (especially water, or tea) before bedtime, so that you have to go to sleep for urination.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is proportional to his physical and mental stress.
Low stress, the vitality of existence will be strong. everyone has the ability to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. the only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is the dynamism and negativity within us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended by many techniques of the Mahayana Path of Love and Indian Yoga.
In theory, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. it includes the path of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and love that embraces all.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini Shakti (Knowledgeable Power) awakens through Yoga Bhangis, breathing exercises, Mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Dev Yoga. through the visualization of different deities, the paths of energy are cleaned, the wheels are activated and the sense of enlightenment is created.
During the Second World War, Germany was the enemy of the two countries, resulting in a rift between Russia and the United States, when the war ended.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War slowly began.
This was to take place for the next 40 years and was to be vigorously enforced from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish resistance was already a disaster, and he was only expected to retreat to the Romanian bridgehead and re-organize it.
However, when more than 800,000 troops of the Soviet-Union Red Army entered into the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Nonviolence Agreement and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral treaties, and violated the eastern parts of Poland, these projects were in effect.
The most efficient way to transport people and goods across the sea is to use ships.
The job of the Navy is to ensure that your country maintains sufficient capacity to carry your people and goods traditionally, while at the same time, hampering the ability of your enemies to carry your people and goods.
One of the most recent examples of this is the WW II North Atlantic Camp. The Americans have tried to send people and goods through the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-boats, tried to stop traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany would have been able to win the other Europe.
The clothes were found to have been used for the first time in Zargos Mountain, Iran, some 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribal peoples began to collect them to protect milk, hair, meat and skin.
Trees were usually bred in swamps on hills or other highlands. sometimes children or teenagers, like a shepherd, used these methods of embroidery.
There were wagons in England about the 16th century.
While the path to the wagons had only parallel wooden boards, the horses were allowed to go to the dragons, as they were moving at a high speed and the heavy goods could also be carried on rough roads.
Crosses were introduced quite early enough to keep the tracks normal. however, it became clear that the tracks would be more efficient if there were a slow iron stipe.
It was a common practice, but it caused friction for the iron, airy wooden wheels.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. in 1767, the first full iron-lines were introduced.
The first transit was that humans had started walking directly two million years ago for one of the Homo erectus (that is, humans standing on the net).
His predecessors, the Australopithecus, were not usually direct.
Parineeti, who used two legs, was found 4.2-3.9 million years ago in the fossils of Australopithias, although Sahelantropas could have been in two legs seven million years ago.
We still have the opportunity to lead an eco-friendly life, participate in the environmental movement and serve as activists, to reduce the risks of future environmental damage to some extent.
This is a treatment that only offers symptoms of the disease in many cases. however, if we do not just have a temporary solution, we should look for the source of the problem and make them inactive.
The world has undergone a lot of changes due to improvements in human science and technology, and problems have increased due to the rich lifestyle of the population and mankind.
After the Congress passed the Bill on July 4, a handwritten note signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to a printing shop near some blocks in John Dunlap.
Around 150 to 200 copies were made throughout the night, which is now called the Dunlop Broad Side.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon at the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, he read it to his forces in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlop Broad Side, known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document left. the original handwritten copies of the copies are not left.
Some polyontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survive and are still alive. we call them birds.
Most people don't see them from the point of view of dinosaurs, because they are winged and can fly.
But there are more things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have a foot consisting of chips and cages, they put eggs on and walk like T-Rex on their 2 back legs.
Almost all the computers in use today are based on the data analysis that is coded in the flight numbers.
The number of pairs can have only 1 of 2 values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called pairs of digits or pieces to use computer terminology.
Internal venom is not immediately visible. symptoms such as vomiting are very common and cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal poison is the presence of a container of open medicine or toxic home use chemicals.
Check the identification list for specific first-aid instructions for a particular poison.
"The name" "bug" "is used by insect scientists in this group of insects."
This term comes from the ancient familiarity of insects, which were parasitic creatures of humans.
Asynchronous stoves and bedbugs are harmless, which live at home or in their home.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), a major neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the brain, spinal cord and the central nervous system.
Research has shown that women are more likely to have two percent of MS than men.
Couples may decide that raising a child is not in their interest or in the interest of their child.
The couple can register their child with the adoption plan.
In adoption, the parents who give birth terminate their parental rights, so that another couple can become parents to the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific method, which guides almost all scientific research.
Moreover, experimentation is also a guide to the examination and scientific research of one or more possible thoughts, asking questions, and conducting observations.
Environmentalists and philosophers focused on Scriptural texts and the Bible in Latin in particular.
Aristotle's views on all matters relating to science, including psychology, are acceptable.
As Greek wisdom faded, Westerners separated themselves from Greek science and philosophy.
As many have observed, there are some levers in physiology and behavior, in particular the presence of endogenesis cycles and their production on biological clocks.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have been recorded not only in response to external cyclic indications, but also in response.
The biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator. even if there is no external pump, the biological clock continues for the duration of the cycle in free circulation.
The study of digestion and tease is an important experiment that indicates that DNA is a genetic material.
Horscha and Chase used bacteria or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two types of experiments using DNA Marking using a radiant catalyst in the bacterial profile or using a radiant vapor in the protein of the phage.
Depending on the mutation, the importance of genetic factors and the affected cells have different effects depending on the micro-line cells.
The mutation in German-line cysts can only be transmitted to children, with variations elsewhere leading to cancer or death of cells.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with a view to enjoying natural landscapes, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example of this is the visit to orangutans in Borneo, their photography and understanding of them.
Every morning, people in this small town go to the place of work through their cars in the country and pass through the place of work close to the place of work.
In this mobile transport system, everyone is connected and supports this transport system based on the use of their own cars.
Science has pointed out that this huge carbon economy, which has been supporting human development for two million years, has shaken the planet from a stable position.
Everyone participates in the development of society and uses the transport system. almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely complain about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why does the transport system generate such complaints, why do they fail all the time? Are transport engineers unqualified? Or are more basic things happening?
The flow of vehicles is the study of the movement between the two points of the individual vehicle and the drivers and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, the behaviour of one driver cannot be estimated at one hundred per cent because it is difficult to study the flow of the vehicle.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a reasonable stable range; therefore, traffic streams can also represent substantially from constancy and as per mathematics.
To better represent the flow of traffic, links have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links will help in planning, design and operations of road infrastructure
The organisms that first flew in the air were insects. their ability to fly helped them escape easily from enemies and to find food and mates more effectively.
Many insects have the advantage of covering the wings throughout their bodies.
It provides a wide range of small places to be forgotten by the predators.
The insects that cannot be rearranged from their wings are dragons and maffles.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Sun Temple was orbiting the Sun.
If some thought that he was right, others were against it, he would say; the solar wind surrounds the sun and the earth (and other stars are not excluded from it either).
It seems to be sensitive, because it doesn't think the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Amazon is also the largest river on earth, extending over six miles in some places.
Amazon accounts for 20 per cent of the water flowing through all the rivers of the earth.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles), which collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the work of building pyramids in stone continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the pyramids in Giza did not surpass the shape and technical expertise of their structure.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at their earlier statues, thousands of years earlier.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, the smallest independent nation in the world and the smallest in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in its statutes and official communications.
The daily language used by most working in the state is also Italian, but Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemicals such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, all of which can be found in natural form and it is easy to use tools of ancient times for mining.
Aristotle, a philosopher, presented the theory that everything in the world is created by one element in four elements: Earth, water, air, and fire.
This is the subject of almost 4 condition (in the same sequence): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although the new object changes to the form we see, he also asserted.
Mixers are usually a mixture of two or more metals. do not forget that there are several elements in the periodic table.
Diamonds such as calcium and phosphorus are considered metals, silver and gold.
Carbon-like alloys can also be made with small amounts of mixed ingredients.
All things have been made in the earth out of dust. all things have been made out of a small particle, the atom.
The size of atoms is so small that billions of atoms can be inserted into the Viraum icon at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil was out, many people had good friends.
Unfortunately, as new methods of writing have come, the grade and use of pencils have been reduced.
People use computers to write messages and do not use a pencil cartridge.
People want to know what the keyboard is like when a new one appears.
Vidal's bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
The way a heavy cycle is blown from the top of the mountain. the nucleus is then broken down and released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they break down and explode a little.
The surface of the moon is made of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
It is 70 km thick and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thin under Maria and thick under high ground.
Because of the crutches, there could be more Maria nearby. Lawa juice was easy to climb to the surface of the ground.
Content receptors try to find out what one likes or dislikes.
As these theories suggest, many of their needs and / or desires are internalized when people reach adulthood.
These theories shed light on what some people specifically want to do and what factors in their environment influence them to do or not do certain things.
Both the preparations for the orderly implementation of the requirements of Moscow and the preparations for the two elements of Hurtberg are well-known.
In general, two behaviours can evolve as executive and lead their eastern partners. one end of this spectrum is to be like all the boys.
It is very difficult for such managers to take unpopular decisions, take discipline, evaluate performance, assign responsibility and make people accountable.
The other end of the same spectrum, changing what the team is doing, and transforming it into an unfamiliar person who thinks he should do everything himself.
However, in the end, the captain is responsible for the team's loss and victory.
This quality often leads to a rift between the team and its leader.
Indigenous teams are the same level as traditional teams, with some degree of differences.
The members of the virtual team act as the contact person of their immediate physical group.
They usually have more autonomy than normal team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not have meant local management.
The presence of a real "inexperienced team" (Larson and LAFASTO, 1989, p109) is also an inexperienced team.
"The" "invisible team" "is the management team that reports to each member. the invisible team sets the criteria for each member."
Why does the organization want to run a time-use process to set up a learning organization? One goal of putting the concepts of corporate learning into practice is that it is innovation.
When all the resources available in the organization's functional divisions are effectively used, creativity and ingenuity automatically emerge.
As a result, the process by which the organization works together to eliminate a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's requirement.
Before institutional innovation, the leaders should create a culture of innovation and a culture of shared knowledge and institutional learning.
Angel (2006) describes the container method as a method used to help organizations achieve high-level performance.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical method of finding knowledge, so it reduces the flow of research and further clarifies it.
The interaction between brain pathology and behavior supports research conducted by scientists.
A lot of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumours have affected our behavior and some mental functions have changed since long.
With the improvement of new technologies, we have been able to see and review previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This will help us to understand these processes in our minds by giving us more information and materials to build simulation models.
Although AI has a strong feature of scientific novel, it is related to behavior, learning, and intelligent transformation, and is a very important part of machine science.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, ability to respond to customer diagnosis and questions, as well as hand-held identification, voice and faces.
Such topics have been transformed into separate sections, which focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence has been widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as in software applications of several computers and video games.
Field trips are a large part of any class. bus trips are often preferred by teachers to take their students to non-selected places.
Technology offers solutions through virtual field trips. students can see museum artifacts, visit aquarium, or admire beautiful artifacts sitting in their classroom.
Sharing the field trip in a virtual way to reflect the trip and sharing experiences with future classes is also a good way to do so.
For example, every year, students at Benet School in South Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the website redesigns and keeps the previous designs used as a scrip book.
Blogs can also help improve the student's writing skills. initially, it is common for students to see spelling and grammar errors in their blog writing, but the presence of readers and the feedback they give change the writing skills.
Students were generally critical observers and started blogging to improve writing to avoid criticism.
"The blogging" "makes students more aware of the world around them." "The need to present the subject according to the interest of the audience encourages students to be intelligent and interesting" "(Totto, 2004)."
Blowing is a tool that motivates collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond traditional school learning.
The proper use of blogs makes students more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet objects, students can determine their position in the context of other writings and formulate their opinions on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Attava is the attractive bilingual capital of Canada, with a series of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
