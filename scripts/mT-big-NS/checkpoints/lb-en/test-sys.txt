In Savann, it is for a primate with a digestive system that is increasingly difficult for humans to meet their amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
In addition, there are serious errors when you do not do that: numbness, deficiency and, ultimately, death.
In the simplest available plant products, the proteins are known to be proteins and larynxes and sleeve membranes, but for primates they must also consume our heavier ones, for which they have not been skinned.
Unlike dozo, the naturally occurring foods (zeemines, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also deliver a waste of proteins that contain all necessary amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own predecessors had solved their "protein problem" on almost the same way and way the chimpanzees would have done it today in the Savann.
